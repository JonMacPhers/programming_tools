	   This is NOT a complete list of tests, it is meant to demonstrate some testing.
           Try to find the right balance between testing, as testing can time consuming and can be overused if not mission crittical.

           A good balance is testing each function for your data structure. Test with expected data and what 
           are known as edge cases, where the code might break. 
	
 	  Most importantly check creating and destroying your structures aren't creating memeory leaks.
